## ðŸ§  Objective

# Create a class called Pet with the following:

# ### Attributes:
# - name: the name of your pet
# - hunger: an integer representing hunger level (0 = full, 10 = very hungry)
# - energy: an integer representing energy level (0 = tired, 10 = fully rested)
# - happiness: an integer (0â€“10)
# ### Methods:
# - eat(): reduces hunger by 3 points (but not below 0), and increases happiness by 1.
# - sleep(): increases energy by 5 points (but not above 10).
# - play(): decreases energy by 2, increases happiness by 2, and increases hunger by 1.
# - get_status(): prints the current state of the pet.

# ### Bonus ðŸŽ¯
# - Add a method train(trick) that teaches your pet a new trick and stores it in a list.
# - Add a method show_tricks() that prints all learned tricks.
